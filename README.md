# Tarot Project

This project is a Tarot card drawing application that allows users to draw cards and view their meanings. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Structure

- **images/**: Contains image files for the tarot cards and the card back. Each image corresponds to a specific tarot card.
- **script.js**: Contains the JavaScript code for the tarot card drawing application. It defines the `tarotCards` array, which holds the card names, meanings, and image paths. It includes functions for shuffling the cards, drawing a card, lazy loading images, and preloading images.
- **styles.css**: Contains the CSS styles for the tarot card application. It includes styles for card flipping animations, hover effects, and general layout.
- **index.html**: The main HTML document for the application. It sets up the structure of the page, including the card display, message area, and button to draw a card. It links to the CSS and JavaScript files.
